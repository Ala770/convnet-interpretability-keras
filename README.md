# Visualizing VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network using Keras
Following visualization techniques are used:
* Visualizing intermediate activations (convolution outputs)
* Visualizing convolutional filter/kernels
* Visualizing input pixel space from intermediate activation using deconvnets
* Visualizing areas of interest in input image for each layer using GradCAM technique
